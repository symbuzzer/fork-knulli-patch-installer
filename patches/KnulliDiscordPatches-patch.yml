    Please be aware that you could break your system if something
    goes wrong. Be careful and mind the risk of having to start over
    with your Knulli setup before you proceed.  You could also just
    wait for the next Knulli release which will most likely come
    with patch applied.

    This post is for the RG40XX H. (Although it also works with the
    RG40XX V.)

    Download the boot image for your device (`rg40xx-boot-modded.img)

    This patch is based on the instructions originally created by
    @dopaz here: https://discord.com/channels/1173228527605272666/1227424831360733305/1269734942934433943

    This will copy the boot image to your device to /tmp/patch

    dd if=/tmp/patch/rg40xx-boot-modded.img of=/dev/mmcblk0p1
    
    Then reboots the system

    And here's v12 of the RG40XX H/V LED scripts (containing code by @Gamma, @Mikhailzrick, and @dopaz).

    This version adapts LED brightness to screen brightness with led.brightness corresponding to 100% screen brightness.

    LED service can be disabled via System Settings -> Services -> Analog_Stick_LED

    Customize in batocera.conf like so:

    led.mode=1

    led.brightness=100

    led.speed=15

    led.colour=148 255 0

    Allowed modes are 0-6 (off, solid, fast breathe, medium breathe, slow breathe, rainbow, rainbow swirl), allowed min/max values for everything else are 0/1-255. By default, led.colour applies to both sticks (RG40XX H). You can optionally use led.colour.right to override the color of the right stick.

    Changes will be applied automatically once you save batocera.conf while the service is running.

    While battery charges the stick breathes green
    When battery charge reaches 20%-6%, the sticks breathes yellow
    When battery charge reaches 5% or less, the sticks breathes red
    When battery charge is above 20%, the sticks turn back to whatever is customized in batocera.conf

    Also, this has a very simple interface for other developers to temporarily override batocera.conf settings, setting a solid color with user-configured brightness by calling
    /usr/bin/analog_stick_led_daemon.sh set 255 255 255

    or return to batocera.conf settings by calling
    /usr/bin/analog_stick_led_daemon.sh import
