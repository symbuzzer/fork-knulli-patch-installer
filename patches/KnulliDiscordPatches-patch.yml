    Please be aware that you could break your system if something
    goes wrong. Be careful and mind the risk of having to start over
    with your Knulli setup before you proceed.  You could also just
    wait for the next Knulli release which will most likely come
    with patch applied.

    This post is for the RG40XX H. (Although it also works with the
    RG40XX V.)

    Download the boot image for your device (`rg40xx-boot-modded.img)
    from this post by @acmeplus here: https://discord.com/channels/1173228527605272666/1227424831360733305/1269846256403087444

    This patch is based on the instructions originally created by
    @dopaz here: https://discord.com/channels/1173228527605272666/1227424831360733305/1269734942934433943

    This will copy the boot image to your device to /tmp/patch

    dd if=/tmp/patch/rg40xx-boot-modded.img of=/dev/mmcblk0p1
    
    Then reboots the system

    And here's v14 of the RG40XX H/V LED scripts (containing code by @Gamma, @Mikhailzrick, and @dopaz).

    This version adapts LED brightness to screen brightness with led.brightness corresponding to 100% screen brightness.
    Fixed: LEDs now work again when plugged to HDMI.
    
    LED service can be disabled via System Settings -> Services -> Analog_Stick_LED

    Customize in batocera.conf like so:

    led.mode=1

    led.brightness=100

    led.speed=15

    led.colour=148 255 0

    Allowed modes are 0-6 (off, solid, fast breathe, medium breathe, slow breathe, rainbow, rainbow swirl), allowed min/max values for everything else are 0/1-255. By default, led.colour applies to both sticks (RG40XX H). You can optionally use led.colour.right to override the color of the right stick.

    Changes will be applied automatically once you save batocera.conf while the service is running.

    While battery charges the stick breathes green
    When battery charge reaches 20%-6%, the sticks breathes yellow
    When battery charge reaches 5% or less, the sticks breathes red
    When battery charge is above 20%, the sticks turn back to whatever is customized in batocera.conf

  requirements:
    boards: 
      - "rg40xx"

  tasks:
    - files:
      - source: "https://github.com/zarquon-42/knulli-patches/raw/refs/heads/main/patches/rg40xx-h-stick-leds-v14-installer.zip"

    - extract:
        - source: "/tmp/patch/rg40xx-h-stick-leds-v14-installer.zip"
          destination: "/tmp/patch"  # Different extraction path

    - executable:
        - path: "/tmp/patch/ledservice_installer.sh"

    - alert:
      - "About to run installer script.  This will cause a reboot."

    And here's v15 of the RG40XX H/V LED scripts (containing code by @Gamma, @Mikhailzrick, and @dopaz).

    New feature: When earning a retro achievement, you will be rewarded by a short rainbow swirl!
    (Thanks to @SargentoTITO for pointing me to this!)
    
    LED service can be disabled via System Settings -> Services -> Analog_Stick_LED

    Customize in batocera.conf like so:

    led.mode=1

    led.brightness=100

    led.speed=15

    led.colour=148 255 0

    led.retroachievements=1 # 0 turns the effect off.

    Allowed modes are 0-6 (off, solid, fast breathe, medium breathe, slow breathe, rainbow, rainbow swirl), allowed min/max values for everything else are 0/1-255.
